<h2>Apps</h2>
<p>This page uses the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/">Okta Resources API</a> <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/apps/">Apps endpoint</a> to get a list of apps for the currently logged in user for purposes of SSO into those apps.</p>
<p>It currently uses the global API key for this purpose; ideally we would use use scoped OAuth 2.0 access tokens.  See: <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta/overview/">https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta/overview/</a></p>
