<p>When a user is authenticated, an access token (in JWT format) is issued, which can be used to authorize access to one or more API endpoints.  In this example, the user uses a token which gives read access to an endpoint that returns a list of products.</p>
<h3>REST</h3>
<p>This application makes use of a REST API called by the client using vanilla Javascript.  The token is stored on the client, either in local or session storage or a cookie, an HTTP POST called via client-side Javascript code uses this value as the <code>Bearer</code> token in the Authorization header.</p>
<p>In this demo app, the token is stored in a cookie.</p>
<p>To understand what's happening on this page, open Chrome Developer Tools to the "Network" tab and refresh the page (it may help to filter requests by "XHR"). Notice a call to a <code>/products</code> URI.  If you click this, you'll see that a request is being made to the application's "products" API endpoint: <code>http://localhost:5000/api/products</code>, including an <code>Authorization: Bearer</code> header containing the access token issued by Okta.  Because the API server has validated the token, the response is a list of products.  Click on the action button for one of the items listed here, and you'll see a similar request, this time to the <code>http://localhost:5000/api/orders</code> endpoint.</p>

<h3>MVC</h3>
<p>An MVC version of this view might store the token on the server side (likely in a database), with a server-side component making the API call. This can be an appropriate architecture for high-security use cases because the token is not stored on the client.</p>
