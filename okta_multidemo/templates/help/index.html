<p>Clicking "Log In" on this page will log your user in using an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/okta-hosted-flows/">Okta-hosted</a> <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/auth-overview/#authorization-code-flow">Authorization Code Flow</a>.**  The "Resource Server" in the diagram below is not involved until the client issues a request to the application's API, separately from authentication.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/custom-hosted-signin/overview/">This guide</a> provides information on how to customize the Okta-hosted sign in page. Okta-hosted sign in is an alternative to embedding the Okta Sign In Widget in your app.</p>
<p>Because this application is a <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/">Flask</a> app written in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, it makes use of the <a href="https://oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">OAuthLib</a> library for its OpenID Connect implementation.</p>
<p>No matter which language or platform you're developing on, you will likely use an open source library that implements the <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> and <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth 2.0</a> protocols.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/auth-overview">OAuth 2.0 Overview</a> to understand differences between OAuth flows.</p>
<p>** Note as of this writing, many websites for both enterprise and consumer use cases implement a login approach where identities are authenticated on a separate domain and redirected to the application after authentication. Some examples of consumer-oriented sites that use this approach include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google (Gmail, etc.): for all services users are redirected to <code>accounts.google.com</code> for authentication.</li>
<li>Ikea: users are redirected to <code>us.accounts.ikea.com</code> for login.</li>
<li>Zappos: users are redirected to <code>auth.zappos.com</code> for login.</li>
</ul>
