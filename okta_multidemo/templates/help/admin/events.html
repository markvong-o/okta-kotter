<h2>Event hooks</h2>
<p>This page will display information about events occurring in your Okta tenant when you've configured an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/event-hooks/">Event Hook</a> to send a payload about the event to your application's API.  Be sure to configure the <code>FF_EVENTS_HOOK_ID</code> environment variable.</p>
<p>E.g. if you have an Event hook configured to listen for "User signed in and session started" (<code>user.session.start</code>), when that event happens in your tenant, you'll see it show up here.</p>
<p>The page requires an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta/overview/">OAuth for Okta</a> token for the <code>okta.eventHooks.read</code> scope, to list all of the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/event-hooks/?#which-events-are-eligible">eligible events</a> that the Event Hook has been configured for, so ensure your administrative user has an appropriate role (Super Administrator does the trick.)</p>
