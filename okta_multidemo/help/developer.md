## Developer Portal

In this section the user can create OAuth 2.0 clients so that external applications can access the resources being protected by Okta's API Access Management.

There are two basic use cases that correspond to two different OAuth 2.0 grant types:

- [Client Credentials](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/auth-overview/#client-credentials-flow) flow: for machine-to-machine (M2M) communication scenarios. A developer can use the client ID and secret, along with a permitted scope, to query an application's API endpoint.  For example, a developer has their own website (App A) that they want to populate with this applicaton's (App B) product data.  They might have a nightly batch job that gathers that data, using this Client Credentials client to securely access it.
- [Authorization Code](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/auth-overview/#authorization-code-flow) flow (with or without PKCE): A developer can use the client ID (and secret if not PKCE) to establish an OIDC connection with from their own app (App A) to the authorization server of this app (App B) responsible for protecting the app's API (or "Resource Server").  Then users from their app can authorize App A to get their data in App B, which may include [explicitly giving consent](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/request-user-consent/overview/) to a particular scope.

**`NOTE:`** The client credentials example will [create a Client Credentials client via API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oauth-clients/#register-new-client) and assign it to an Access Policy that allows the `products:read` scope, so that the theoretical App A described above can get a list of products from the API protected by Okta API Access Management.
